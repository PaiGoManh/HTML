            <p>
                <h3>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end applications that connect 
                with API’s and other backend technologies. I’m passionate about learning new 
                technologies and understand there is more than one way to accomplish a task. 
                Though I am most proficient in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, 
                Javascript, and React, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as needed. 
                think being a great developer means using the right tools for each job, instead of 
                sticking to just one way of doing things
