            <h3>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end applications that connect 
            with API’s and other backend technologies. I’m passionate about learning new 
            technologies and understand there is more than one way to accomplish a task. 
            Though I am most proficient in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, 
            Javascript, and React, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as needed. 
            think being a great developer means using the right tools for each job, instead of 
            sticking to just one way of doing things
            </h3>
